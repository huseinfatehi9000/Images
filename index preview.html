                <h1>Who I Am</h1>
                
                <p>I'm an Information Systems student at California State University, Northridge with a concentration in Software Technology and an associate's degree in Biology. I'm building skills across software, automation, and modern AI tools, and I enjoy turning rough ideas into practical systems that help real people move faster and work more efficiently. I work with tools like Make, GitHub, and current AI assistants to prototype automation workflows, streamline processes, and develop small web projects.</p>
                
                <p>Right now, I'm running structured experiments around habit formation, distraction-proofing, and effective learning, applying research-backed approaches to improve focus and build stronger study and productivity routines. My interests fall at the intersection of software, AI, and operational execution, and I'm exploring paths in areas like SaaS customer success, tech sales, workflow design, and no-code/AI-driven automation.</p>
                
                <p>I'm looking to connect with people and teams who value speed, clarity, and measurable outcomes—environments where I can contribute both in technical details and in the day-to-day work required to keep projects moving.</p>

                <h1>Interests & Skills</h1>
                
                <h2>Tech and Software</h2>
                <p>I'm really into tech, software, and AI because they let me build things that scale. I like being able to turn an idea into something real—whether that's a small web project, an automation, or a system that saves time. Working with AI tools and no-code platforms feels natural to me, and I enjoy stitching tools together to remove manual work and keep things running in the background.</p>
                
                <h2>Career Direction</h2>
                <p>I'm drawn to roles and paths in tech and business that offer strong growth and clear upside. I think a lot about where I want my career to go, how to make the most of my opportunities, and how to position myself for better roles and networks over time.</p>
                
                <h2>Programming Foundations</h2>
                <p>I care about getting stronger in the basics—Java, data structures, simple web development, and the core ideas behind computer science. I don't want to just copy things. I want to actually understand how they work so I can take on harder projects later.</p>
                
                <h2>Learning and Habits</h2>
                <p>I spend a lot of time thinking about how to learn better. I run my own small experiments around habit-building, distraction control, and doing hard work on command. I'm trying to create systems that make consistency easier and turn good behavior into something automatic.</p>
                
                <h2>Focus and Mindfulness</h2>
                <p>I'm also interested in mindfulness and focus—not in a spiritual way, but as a way to keep my mind calmer and sharper. I like anything that helps me hold focus longer and stay steady under pressure.</p>
                
                <h2>Science and History</h2>
                <p>I follow science and tech news because I care about where the world is going and how I should shape my skills around that. I enjoy big-picture questions, whether it's about future tech or history. Lately, I've been especially drawn to early Islamic history and how different empires rose, fell, and made decisions.</p>
                
                <h2>Communication and Content</h2>
                <p>I've been studying communication, humor, and charisma. I want to be better on camera, more engaging with people, and more confident in how I present myself. I like breaking down what makes content interesting and learning how to make my own short-form videos better.</p>
                
                <h2>Health and Routines</h2>
                <p>Health and daily routines matter to me too. I'm still figuring things out, but I see exercise, sleep, and structure as the foundation for everything else I want to do.</p>
                
                <h2>Overall Direction</h2>
                <p>Overall, I'm trying to build a mix of skills—technical, personal, and career-focused—that raise my ceiling and open up better opportunities over time.</p>
