            <h1>Interests & Skills</h1>
            
            <h2>Tech and Software</h2>
            <p>I'm really into tech, software, and AI because they let me build things that scale. I like being able to turn an idea into something real—whether that's a small web project, an automation, or a system that saves time. Working with AI tools and no-code platforms feels natural to me, and I enjoy stitching tools together to remove manual work and keep things running in the background.</p>
            
            <h2>Career Direction</h2>
            <p>I'm drawn to roles and paths in tech and business that offer strong growth and clear upside. I think a lot about where I want my career to go, how to make the most of my opportunities, and how to position myself for better roles and networks over time.</p>
            
            <h2>Programming Foundations</h2>
            <p>I care about getting stronger in the basics—Java, data structures, simple web development, and the core ideas behind computer science. I don't want to just copy things. I want to actually understand how they work so I can take on harder projects later.</p>
            
            <h2>Learning and Habits</h2>
            <p>I spend a lot of time thinking about how to learn better. I run my own small experiments around habit-building, distraction control, and doing hard work on command. I'm trying to create systems that make consistency easier and turn good behavior into something automatic.</p>
            
            <h2>Focus and Mindfulness</h2>
            <p>I'm also interested in mindfulness and focus—not in a spiritual way, but as a way to keep my mind calmer and sharper. I like anything that helps me hold focus longer and stay steady under pressure.</p>
            
            <h2>Science and History</h2>
            <p>I follow science and tech news because I care about where the world is going and how I should shape my skills around that. I enjoy big-picture questions, whether it's about future tech or history. Lately, I've been especially drawn to early Islamic history and how different empires rose, fell, and made decisions.</p>
            
            <h2>Communication and Content</h2>
            <p>I've been studying communication, humor, and charisma. I want to be better on camera, more engaging with people, and more confident in how I present myself. I like breaking down what makes content interesting and learning how to make my own short-form videos better.</p>
            
            <h2>Health and Routines</h2>
            <p>Health and daily routines matter to me too. I'm still figuring things out, but I see exercise, sleep, and structure as the foundation for everything else I want to do.</p>
            
            <h2>Overall Direction</h2>
            <p>Overall, I'm trying to build a mix of skills—technical, personal, and career-focused—that raise my ceiling and open up better opportunities over time.</p>
